# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

## Project Objective
The primary goal of this project was to analyze a dataset of telecom customers to identify the key factors that lead to customer churn. By understanding these drivers, the business can develop targeted strategies to improve customer retention and reduce revenue loss.

## Tools Used
* **Python:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **Pandas:** For loading and cleaning the data.
* **Seaborn & Matplotlib:** For creating visualizations to communicate findings.

## Key Findings & Visualizations

The analysis revealed several critical factors that strongly correlate with a customer's decision to churn.

### Finding 1: Contract Type is the Biggest Predictor of Churn
Customers on a **Month-to-Month contract churn at a significantly higher rate** than those on one or two-year contracts. This suggests a lack of long-term commitment makes them more likely to switch providers.

### Finding 2: Fiber Optic Customers Have a High Churn Rate
While Fiber Optic is a premium service, customers using it are more likely to churn than those on DSL. This could indicate issues with service reliability, pricing, or a mismatch between customer expectations and service delivery.

### Finding 3: Higher Monthly Charges Correlate with Higher Churn
The data shows that customers who churn tend to have higher monthly bills. This is especially true for the high-churn group of fiber optic customers.
